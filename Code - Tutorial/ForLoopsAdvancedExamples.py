"""" Guideliness for bonues

1) I want you to build a formula for bonuses
2) Employees are placed in cells by their work ethic
3) give each employee a bonus which will be based on his place in the list, multiply it by 100 (bonus = place * 100)
4) The boss said to give bonus by jumping +3 each time in the list
5) The boss said the the first employee (cell index 0) does not deserve any bonus

"""

salary = [1000,2000,3000,4000,5000,6000,7000,8000,9000]

for place in range(0, 9, 3):
    if place == 0:
        pass

    else:
        salary_with_bonus = salary[place] + place * 100
        print(salary_with_bonus)
