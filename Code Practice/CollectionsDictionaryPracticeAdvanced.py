# Create a dictionary of building attendants

# Extract the nested cell items
print("(2) - 1st floor items of the dictionary : " +str(build_attendants['floor_1']))

# Extract of who ever lives in the second apartment = 'Jeen'
print("(3) - Print of the attendant in the 2nd apartment : " +str(build_attendants['floor_1']['second_apartment']))

# Add a 4th apartment on floor 2
build_attendants['floor_2']['forth_apartment'] = "Carrol"
print("The dictionary after adding 'Carrol' : " +str(build_attendants))

# Remove the 1st apartment of the dictionary
build_attendants['floor_1'].pop("first_apartment")
print("Print of the dictionary after removing 1st apartment " +str(build_attendants))
